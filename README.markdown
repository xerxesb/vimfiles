# Once upon a time in the projects, yo.

VIM was reborn like unto the noble phoenix.  And so it was as it always should be since the dawn of the end of times.

# Warning: Submodules

I always get caught not initializing and updating git submodules when I clone a repo. Don't be like me.

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
